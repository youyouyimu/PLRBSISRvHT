This code is for our paper "Piecewise-Linear-Regression-Based-Single-Image-Super-Resolution-via-Hadamard-Transform"

The modcrop function is from the source code of:
C. Dong, C. C. Loy, K. He, and X. Tang. Learning a deep convolutional network for image super-resolution. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 184Â¨C199.
Springer, 2014.

The training dataset used in our paper can be generated by file "create_train_data.m".

The learned mapping models as well as the decision tree for scaling factor 2 can be directly used for SR reconstruction.
