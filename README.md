==========================================================================================================================================
This code is for our paper "Piecewise-Linear-Regression-Based-Single-Image-Super-Resolution-via-Hadamard-Transform"

==========================================================================================================================================
Requirements:
The code is developed with Matlab (R2015a) and was tested under Windows 7 (64 bit). The library "Eigen" is requried to use the code, which is for the mex/cpp files.

==========================================================================================================================================
Building the code:
There is only a single mex/cpp file included in this package that can be build with the MATLAB function "mex". The steps are:
  - mex -setup C++
  - mex SR_Hadamard.cpp
  
We provide a pre-compiled file "SR_Hadamard.mexw64" for Windows 7 (64 bit). 

==========================================================================================================================================
Using the code:
The file "SR_demo" is the demo usage of the proposed algorithm.


The modcrop function is from the source code of:
C. Dong, C. C. Loy, K. He, and X. Tang. Learning a deep convolutional network for image super-resolution. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 184Â¨C199. Springer, 2014.

The training dataset used in our paper can be generated by file "create_train_data.m".

The learned mapping models as well as the decision tree for scaling factor 2 can be directly used for SR reconstruction.
